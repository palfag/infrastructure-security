1. Using the nth mode (round robin mode).

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 8080 -m statistic --mode nth --every 3 --packet 0 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.60.5:8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 8080 -m statistic --mode nth --every 2 --packet 0 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.60.6:8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.60.7:8080


2. Using the random mode.

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 8080 -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.33 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.60.5:8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 8080 -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.5 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.60.6:8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.60.7:8080


Notice that 3 different probabilities are defined and not 0.33 everywhere. 
The reason is that the rules are executed sequentially.

With a probability of 0.33, the first rule will be executed 33% of the time and skipped 66% of the time.

With a probability of 0.5, the second rule will be executed 50% of the time and skipped 50% of the time. 
However, since this rule is placed after the first one, it will only be executed 66% of the time. 
Hence this rule will be applied to only \(50\%*66\%=33\%\) of requests.

Since only 33% of the traffic reaches the last rule, it must always be applied.
