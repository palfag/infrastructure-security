Task 7.

In an real VPN system, the traffic will be encrypted (this part is not covered in this lab). That means the
return traffic must come back from the same tunnel. How to get the return traffic from Host V to the VPN
server is non-trivial. Our setup simplifies the situation. In our setup, Host Vâ€™s routing table has a default
setting: packets going to any destination, except the 192.168.60.0/24 network, will be automatically
routed to the VPN server.

In the real world, Host V may be a few hops away from the VPN server, and the default routing entry
may not guarantee to route the return packet back to the VPN server. Routing tables inside a private network
have to be set up properly to ensure that packets going to the other end of the tunnel will be routed to the
VPN server. To simulate this scenario, we will remove the default entry from Host V, and add a more specific
entry to the routing table, so the return packets can be routed back to the VPN server. Students can use the
following commands to remove the default entry and add a new entry:

// Delete the default entry
# ip route del default

// Add an entry
# ip route add <network prefix> via <router ip>

Comandi da eseguire nell'Host V:

ip route del default

ip route add 192.168.53.0/24 via 192.168.60.11
